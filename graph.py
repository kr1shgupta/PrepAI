"""The interview loop as a LangGraph state machine.

    ask -> listen (interrupt: wait for the candidate) -> grade -> decide -+-> ask
                                                                         +-> report -> END

Every answer is graded against a rubric and appended to `turns`. `decide` is plain
Python over those grades: it picks the next move (dig deeper, go harder, challenge a
contradiction, change topic, wrap up). The final report reads the same `turns`, so the
evaluation is accumulated answer by answer rather than guessed from the transcript.
